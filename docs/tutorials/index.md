## Authoring Notes

- Keep commands exactly as executed; paste terminal output instead of paraphrasing (per `.github/copilot-instructions.md`).
- Preserve Divio tone: each tutorial solves one job without branching decision trees.
- Cross-link to How-To guides when the workflow branches into configuration options (e.g., proxies, Playwright storage).
