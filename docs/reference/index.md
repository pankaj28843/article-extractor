# Reference

**Audience & Prereqs**: Engineers in the Reference lane of the [Docs Coverage Map](../coverage-map.md#scenario-routing-table) who already know *what* they want to configure; bring familiarity with the CLI/server from earlier tutorials.  
**Outcome**: Canonical lookup tables that mirror `src/article_extractor/**`.

- [Configuration Table](configuration.md) — env vars, storage queue settings, `.env` tips.
- [Runtime Interfaces](runtime.md) — CLI commands, FastAPI endpoints, Python API snippets, and common use cases.

When updating references, copy values directly from code/tests and link to How-To guides whenever instructions explain *how* to apply a change.
