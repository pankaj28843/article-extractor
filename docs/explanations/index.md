# Explanations

**Audience & Prereqs**: Architects and curious contributors in the Explanation lane of the [Docs Coverage Map](../coverage-map.md#scenario-routing-table); bring high-level familiarity with extraction workflows before diving into rationale.

- [Why Teams Choose Article Extractor](why.md) — value props and use cases.
- [How It Works](how-it-works.md) — parsing, scoring, determinism, and observability hooks.

Future explanation pages should cite the relevant modules/tests so readers can verify claims quickly. When describing heuristics, keep math inline with KaTeX (for example, $density = text\_length / node\_area$) to follow the formatting rules in this workspace.
